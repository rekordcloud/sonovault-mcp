description: Look up music metadata with the SonoVault API. Use when the user needs track, artist, label, or release data. ISRC or ISWC codes, genre, release dates, or a track's IDs and links on Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Beatport, Discogs, MusicBrainz, or YouTube. Covers single lookups, bulk resolution of play logs and library exports, and royalty-reporting enrichment.

You query the SonoVault music metadata API: 90M+ tracks with ISRC, ISWC, genre, label, release dates, and cross-platform IDs.

## Setup

- Base URL: `https://api.sonovault.now`
- Every request needs the API key header: `x-api-key: $SONOVAULT_API_KEY`
- Read the key from the `SONOVAULT_API_KEY` environment variable. If it is missing, tell the user to get a free key at https://sonovault.now (1,000 requests/month, no credit card) and export it.
- All responses are JSON, snake_case. List endpoints paginate with `next_cursor`; pass it back as `cursor`. `next_cursor` is null on the last page.

If the environment has the SonoVault MCP server available (`sonovault-mcp`), prefer its tools over raw HTTP.

## When to activate

- The user asks about a track, artist, label, or release: genre, label, release date, ISRC.
- The user has an ISRC or ISWC code, or wants one.
- The user wants a track's ID or link on another platform.
- The user has a list to enrich: a radio play log, a DJ library export, a CSV of ISRCs.

## Core recipes

### Find a track (and its ISRC)

Search requires BOTH `artist` and `title`. There is no free-text `q` parameter.

```bash
curl -s "https://api.sonovault.now/v1/tracks/search?artist=Daft+Punk&title=One+More+Time&limit=5" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SONOVAULT_API_KEY"
```

Each result carries `id`, `title`, `artists`, `isrc`, `duration`, `genre`, `subgenre`, and `releases` (album title, label, release_date). The search is fuzzy: it survives `(Original Mix)` suffixes, `feat.` credits, and messy casing, so pass raw playout strings as-is.

### Look up by ISRC

ISRC is a path parameter, not a query parameter:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.sonovault.now/v1/tracks/isrc/GBDUW0000053" -H "x-api-key: $SONOVAULT_API_KEY"
```

One canonical track can carry many ISRCs (radio edit, remaster, reissue each mint their own). Any of them resolves to the same track. Cross-source ISRC disagreement is normal, not an error.

### Cross-platform IDs and links

Pass exactly ONE identifying parameter: `id`, `isrc`, `spotify_id`, `applemusic_id`, `tidal_id`, `beatport_id`, `discogs_id`, `musicbrainz_id`, or `youtube_id`.

```bash
curl -s "https://api.sonovault.now/v1/tracks/links?isrc=GBDUW0000053" -H "x-api-key: $SONOVAULT_API_KEY"
```

Returns one entry per platform with `external_id` and a deep link `url`.

### ISWC (composition codes)

Recording to work: `GET /v1/tracks/iswc?isrc=...` (or `?id=<track id>`). Returns the ISWC(s) behind the recording; a track can have several (medleys, samples), or none.
Work to recordings: `GET /v1/tracks/iswc/T0710204399`. Dotted and dashed ISWC formats are accepted. Returns recordings by popularity with a representative ISRC each.

### Bulk resolve (up to 100 lines per call)

Use for play logs and library exports instead of looping over search. Costs one API credit per line.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.sonovault.now/v1/tracks/resolve" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SONOVAULT_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input_type": "track_name", "items": [{"artist": "Daft Punk", "title": "Aerodynamic"}]}'
```

`input_type` is one of `track_name`, `isrc`, `sonovault_id`, `spotify_id`, `applemusic_id`, `tidal_id`, `beatport_id`, `discogs_id`, `musicbrainz_id`. Items are strings, except `track_name` items which are `{artist, title}` objects. Each result row has `status` (`matched`, `not_found`, or `skipped_no_credits`), the `track`, and its `links`. Report not_found lines to the user rather than dropping them silently.

### Artists, labels, releases, genres

- `GET /v1/artists/search?name=...`, `GET /v1/artists/:id`, `GET /v1/artists/:id/releases` (newest first)
- `GET /v1/labels/search?name=...`, `GET /v1/labels/:id/releases`, `GET /v1/labels/:id/artists`
- `GET /v1/releases/search?title=...&artist=...`, `GET /v1/releases/:id` (includes full tracklist with ISRCs)
- `GET /v1/genres` (canonical genre hierarchy with IDs)

## Royalty-report enrichment

Radio play logs carry artist + title but royalty reports (SoundExchange, PPL, Sena, GVL, Re:Sound) match on ISRC and label. Resolve the log with bulk resolve, then output artist, title, ISRC, album, and label per line. Always tell the user to verify data before filing; SonoVault aggregates third-party data and is not affiliated with any collecting society.

## Errors and limits

- 401: bad or missing key. 403 with "paid" wording: the endpoint needs a paid tier (`/v1/tracks/browse`, audio identify). 429: rate limit (retry after the `Retry-After` header) or monthly credits exhausted (do not retry; tell the user).
- The public API does NOT expose BPM, musical key, popularity scores, audio previews, artwork, or lyrics. Say so instead of guessing.
